# DVD Screensaver Loading Screen

### What does it change?
It replaces Garry's Mod's default loading screen that appears when connecting to a server.

### Can other people see my loading screen when they connect to my server?
No. This is purely local - only you will see it.

### How to install
1. Locate your Garry's Mod folder (there are plenty of guides available to help with this)
2. Navigate to `garrysmod/html`
3. Rename the original `loading.html` to something else (for backup)
4. Copy the contents of `dvd-screensaver-loading-screen` into `garrysmod/html`

### How to uninstall
1. Delete `dvd_logo.png` and `loading.html`
2. Rename your original HTML file back to `loading.html`*

*If you've lost the original `loading.html`, you can verify the integrity of game files (there are many guides available for this as well)
